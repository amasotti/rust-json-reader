# Rust file reader

This is a small example of how to read a file in Rust.
The project is my solution to the first assignment of the course [Rust Programming Specialization](Part of the Coursera specialization [Rust Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/rust-programming) on Coursera
by Alfredo Deza.

### Learning objectives

- Read a file in Rust 
- Handle errors in Rust
- Familiarize with the `Result` type, `match` and `unwrap` in Rust
- Have fun with Rust :)

I've called it json_reader, since I wanted to experiment with the `serde_json` crate
and have a json pretty print of the file content.
